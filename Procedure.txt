Setup Your Development Environment:

Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) if you haven't already.
Set up a PostgreSQL database and ensure you have the necessary credentials (username, password, host, port, etc.).
Create a new Node.js project directory for your Club Management System.

Install Dependencies:

Initialize your Node.js project with npm init.
Install necessary dependencies such as Express.js (for building the web server), pg (for PostgreSQL database connection), EJS (for templating engine), and any other dependencies you may need.

Create Database Schema:

Use the table structure outlined earlier to create the necessary tables in your PostgreSQL database.
You can use tools like pgAdmin or SQL scripts to create the tables and define relationships between them.

Set Up Express Server:

Create an app.js file (or any other name you prefer) to set up your Express.js server.
Configure routes for handling different HTTP requests (GET, POST) for the homepage, authentication, club exploration, membership, and events.
