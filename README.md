# ClubWise-UniversityClubManagementSystem


 
Our project ClubWise has 3 types of users: visitor/students, club members, admin panel.

A visitor can at first enter the homepage that offers: SignUp (including CreateAccount, VerifyID, Login), About Us, Reach Us (Communicating medium); Once signed-in, he can explore other features, such as buying club merchandises (even if he isn't a member of that club, membership brings him an amount of discount). Visitors can explore clubs; in other words, there'll be a page where one can land to explore existing clubs & click on specific ones to know further details, as well as about the events held by the clubs. Visitors can participate event by going through a process called 'enroll', he can also give a feedback on his experience on the event (it can be a star-rating system). A visitor can apply for membership for a specific or several clubs; the approval is given by admin panel, once approved one can be considered a club member.

As a club member one can involve in hosting events, magazine works, selling merchandise, ensuring attendance in club meetings, managing his own club profile. Opting for event has several features/steps: view upcoming events, submit event proposal, volunteer, review feedbacks (given by visitors), review event idea; Admin panel will be responsible to approve & launch these ideas & events. Regarding magazine works, one can invite writings; for that one can send notif & boost the promotion post; there can be a system to collect contents from students from within & outside the club, submit & review them; admin panel will approve contents & publish them on the magazine.

A user can customize his own profile, customize settings; in order to customize his profile, he may need to verify his id again; admin panel can assign them roles as club members; admin panel has control over rejecting membership application or removing an existing club member. So far this is the overall scenario of ClubWise.
